# Intelligent-Monitoring
Using Data Science techniques for intelligent monitoring at large scale

Intelligent Monitoring is a project working to leverage Data Science teqchinques for better insights into the overall health of systems.  The goals is to achive more then a static binary check for the systems health. Instead, to develop a dynamicly changing module that will give insight to a wide range of different "sick" systems and provide recommendations of how to heal.  

## Goals of the Project

- Better insight into the halth and status of all systems
- Predictive vs Reactive monitoring
- Self Healing networks that able to detect and solve issues without human interaction
- Predictive capacity managment and operational planning

## Data Gathering Tools

Prometheuswas chosen for the bullet points below:

- Dimensional Data
